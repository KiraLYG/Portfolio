# üöÄ Portfolio on Go 
The repository contains projects that demonstrate backend development skills in Go.
Here you will find implementation of RESTful API, websockets, parsers and utilities for working with data.
*Target*: Demonstrate ability to solve a variety of problems, write clean code, and work with popular tools in the Go ecosystem.

## üõ† Technologies

    Language: Go 1.21+

    Libraries:

        gorilla/websocket

        encoding/json, encoding/xml

    Tools: Go Modules, Git

## üìÇ Projects

### **DayList.go**

add - Adding a note (go run DayList.go add "Your Note")

list - View all notes (go run DayList.go list)

delete - Deleting a note by id (go run DayList.go delete (ID))

### **RESTful_API.go**

**Description**: Microservice for managing resources (tasks, users) with support for CRUD operations.

First, the main RESTful_API.go file is started

Management commands:

Get a list of tasks:
curl http://localhost:8080/tasks

Create a new task:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/tasks \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title": "–ü–µ—Ä–≤–∞—è –∑–∞–¥–∞—á–∞", "description": "–û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∑–∞–¥–∞—á–∏", "completed": false}'

Get a task by ID:
curl http://localhost:8080/tasks/1

Update a task by ID:
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/tasks/1 \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title": "–û–±–Ω–æ–≤–ª—ë–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∑–∞–¥–∞—á–∞", "description": "–ù–æ–≤–æ–µ –æ–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ", "completed": true}'

Delete an task by ID
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/tasks/1

### **Tracker.go**

**Description**: CLI utility for tracking time and tasks.

Creating an issue:
go run Tracker.go start "Your task"
If a task with that name exists, a new session is added to it, otherwise a new task is created.

Check the issue status:
go run Tracker.go status

Stop the session:
go run Tracker.go stop

Displays a list of all tasks with a total time count for all sessions:
go run Tracker.go list

### **rssparser.go**

**Description**: Parsing RSS feeds (for example, news sites) into structured data.

Example:
go run rssparser.go https://habr.com/ru/rss/all/all/

### **fileutil.go**

This command will recursively traverse the specified directory and output groups of duplicates:
go run fileutil.go duplicates /path/to/directory

This command will rename all files in the specified directory, adding the specified prefix and sequence number to each name:
go run fileutil.go rename /path/to/directory newprefix

### **WebChat**

**Description**: Chat using websockets for instant messaging.

! Attention! This file uses a package github.com/gorilla/websocket . Install this package before launching.

First you need to run the main file WebChat.go
go run WebChat.go

After that, you need to go to http://localhost:8080
